# Propositional prover

This repo contains a simple OCaml written propositional prover, using simply typed lambda calculus (Propositional prover/prover.ml) and using dependent types (Propositional prover/dependent_types.ml).

It was written as a project for the course  [INF551 â€“ Computational logic: from Artificial intelligence to Zero bugs](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram/teaching/INF551/)

It also contains other files I wrote for this course, some in OCaml, and others in Agda.
